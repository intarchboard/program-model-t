- eliot -  troublesome scope (people in rats, suit etc working on new way forward, multiple trust anchors, multiple components, ...)
  - for 3552 update, create a wg
  - iab work should be more than that though
  - broader  scope, including evolving trust models, incl. evolution in chip design
  
mark:
- wants route to closure
- really two tracks: principles and threat models (the latter perhaps not at the iab)
- principle drafts are good for the iab
- rfc 3552 is from 2003. the tm is not current.
- but we didn't have a way to transfer the work to the 3552
- unlike eliot we should go away and do something about 3552

martin:
- likes mark's two approaches
- original goal was incubation but we failed, we didn't really take the endpoint  security all the way to the complex multi-faceded thing that is not easy to reason  about. not sure the work in suit etc is far enough for us to take that forward yet.
- two docs, principles , not  clear if this is the right forum though

john mattsson:
- what's important is updated threat model. your device, your intermediary, and other endpoint are not always 100% trusted
- maybe an update is harder, than a new document.

mallory
- current work falls in two categories, agree with martin that iab should prioritize.
- but also agree with eliot that we need to look at the long-term view. maybe irtf on these things?

colin:
- originally proposed in irtf, didn't fit there necessarily.
- agree with view that 3552 updates need to be in ietf
- also agree principles go for iab
- unclear what's left

chris:
- some things are already asked in  the context of ppm

martin:
- +1 to ppm
- maybe piecewise evolution

summary

eliot
- not hold up

mirja:
- there's definitely work  to be done
- not clear if they are for the program
- principles and docs can be progressed in the iab without a program
- is model-t useful as a program

jim:
- agree with mirja
- but if we close down model-t it sends a wrong signal
- we seem to be talking  about what's the right forum for piece X
- need to step back of what tthings are priority and achievable, and proiritize them.
- what are achievable deliverables?

mirja.
- history not a good experience
- maybe we close but have  an alternative plan/forum

jim:
- more modesty & pragmatism?

mark:
- agree with mirja
- we should plan a roadmaps to closure?

next steps
- mark and jari to pursue the plans for threat model + principles
- meet in smaller groups to make a proposa[
- another meeting in january to review
